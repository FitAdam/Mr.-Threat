        <p>The HTTP 404, 404 Not Found, 404, 404 Error, Page Not Found, File Not Found, or Server Not Found error
            message is a
            Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate
            that the browser was able to communicate
            with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested. The error may also be used when a
            server does not wish to disclose whether
            it has the requested information.

            The website hosting server will typically generate a "404 Not Found"

            web page when a user attempts to follow a broken or dead link; hence the 404 error is one of the most
            recognizable errors encountered on the World Wide Web. [Source: Wikipedia] </p>
